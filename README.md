None

**####What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
None


**###Week 3: 21/04 - 27/04:


**####What tasks did I work on / complete?**
Researched on design patterns that provides a way for object restoration to restore users previous checkpoint.
Implemented memento pattern to provide users a way to restore form the last checkpoint.

**####XP value Feedback:
Proposed changes of few technical stories to enable additional user stories implementation.

**####What am I planning to work on next?
Bugs and code smell fixes 
Sequence diagrams

**####What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?
None


**###Week 2: 14/4 - 20/4:


**####What tasks did I work on / complete?**

Found that Tetris game could not be efficiently implemented on greenfoot.
Researched on various other games and came up with a game inspired by TV series Game of Thrones(GOT).
Performed analysis on the GOT game and features that can be implemented on greenfoot.
Had a brainstorming session with the team to come up with below
Features to be implemented 
User stories
Breakdown of user stories into tasks
Task allocation
Researched on design patterns that can potentially be used for the features in the project
Design Discussion with the team to come up with a high-level architecture of the project.
Implemented factory pattern to spawn players.
Asset collection for title screen and night king.


**###XP value Feedback:**
Provided feedback on architecture and user stories for the new game that needed to be implemented on priority to ensure timely completion of tasks.

Design Discussion with the team to come up with a high-level architecture of the project

**###XP value Communication:**
Discussed with teamamtes about :
To complete baseline features of the project first to enable base features.
Implement novel design patterns of the project for the WOW factor.

**####What am I planning to work on next?**
Derive use case specification from the user stories
Draw UML Diagrams to define micro architecture of the features at hand.


**####What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?**
None.
