# Week 1 Scrum Report 4/6 - 4/13:

## Vignesh Thyagarajan

### Tasks worked on/completed 
- Task1: Worked on figuring out what approach to use to build interactive application/game, between Processing and Greenfoot. Did research on the advantages for each, any challenges that we might face in using Processing/Greenfoot.
- Task2: Helped decide on the game possibly being a version of Tetris. Also helped figure out what patterns can possibly be used in the implementation of Tetris, and what we can do to vary the game/make it interesting, scope in adding extra patterns.
- Task3: Discuss GoT game as a potential option if Tetris doesnâ€™t work out, as the game seemed complex to implement (realized a few days after week 1 scrum started)

### Planned Next Week 
- Task1: Creating the basic game environment, with all the required classes.
- Task2: Writing the patterns we agreed upon. 

### Problems
- Finding the specific assets for game, implementing the various patterns.
- Finding ways to make the game different and enjoyable while ensuring patterns are used.

### XP Value (Communication):
- Talked in length with teammates about the game we should implement, various patterns that we can use, extra patterns we can use, etc.
